# citadel-dev-tools

This was a tool that I originally designed to automatically no apps on Umbrel, modified to work on Citadel and also do automatic updated. However, it was a third (or 4th) parser of the app.yml format to maintain, and also wasn't very optimized.

With the release of [app-cli](https://github.com/runcitadel/app-cli), it has been rewritten as `app-cli update`, so this tool is not needed anymore.

A modified version of this tool, with its original purpose restored, now powers [Upbrel](https://aarondewes.github.io/upbrel/): [umbrel-apps-api](https://github.com/AaronDewes/umbrel-apps-api).
